VisionaryAI – Simple Explanation

VisionaryAI is a web application that can recognize objects in images.
You upload an image, and the app tells you what objects are present in it.
It shows the top three predictions along with how confident the model is.

The app does not train a model from scratch.
It uses a pre-trained deep learning model to classify images quickly and accurately.



How it works (simple flow)

The user uploads an image using the web page.

The image is resized to a fixed size required by the model.

The image is cleaned and normalized so the model can understand it.

The deep learning model analyzes the image.

The app shows the top three object names with confidence percentages.



Technologies used (in simple words)

Streamlit: Used to build the web interface

TensorFlow and Keras: Used to run the deep learning model

MobileNetV2: A ready-made image classification model

OpenCV and Pillow: Used for image processing

Python: Main programming language



Main features

Easy to use image upload page

Fast predictions because the model is loaded only once

Shows a loading message while analyzing the image

Displays multiple predictions instead of only one
